php-rest-api
============

A simple RESTful API in PHP. Based on a [blog post by Corey Maynard](http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/).

Works well with [db_utils.php](https://gist.github.com/bencentra/9312292) and [dbInfo.inc](https://gist.github.com/bencentra/6630e0ffdee885e4b1bf) for database operations.
